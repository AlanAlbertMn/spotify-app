### Spotify app repository
Front-end app tha consumes RapidAPI endpoint for the Spotify data.
Shows the ability to search for an album or artist via the search bar and pressing _'Enter'_ or clicking _'Search'_ button. After clicking the card for any album or artist, the user is redirected to the real spotify app.

### TODOs
- Change behaviour so instead of opening spotify, we fetch the songs of the album or top songs from the artist and display them in a scrollable floating card
- Refactor code to make it more modular
